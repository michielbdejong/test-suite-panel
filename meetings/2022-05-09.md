## Topics

* SC: The Test Suite Panel is a "horizontal" panel. We need to revisit/clarify our understanding of the Test Suite Panel alongside other panels in the CG as well as contributors to specs and implementers.


### Test Suite Panel Charter
* SC: We need to stabilise a mutual understanding and a coordination plan. To advance our work, we need to agree on a charter that details its goals, scope, deliverables, decision policy (e.g., along the lines of https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/notifications-panel-charter.md ).
* SC: Here are some proposed actions. In these proposals, I assume that:
  * Anyone can write a test.
  * Anyone can contribute to the actions.
  * Tests and reports that are not approved for publication at locations acknowledged by the Editors Team is out of scope for the Charter.
  * Software maintainers give consent for reports to be published.
  * Charter may be updated based on the needs of the CG.

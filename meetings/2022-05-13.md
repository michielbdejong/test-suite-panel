## Topics

### How we report about ACP-based servers
MJ: Currently, https://solidservers.org reports pod.inrupt.com as incompatible with Solid.
Should we add a way to report something like "Compatible with ACP-flavoured Solid" or just stick to the text of version 0.9 of the Solid spec?
MJ: I think if we could find a way to reconcile the differences between the WAC-based spec and Inrupt's ACP-based implementation,
a lot of the tension in the community, and a lot of the friction we run into as a panel, could be alleviated.

### Continue writing down our charter
We got quite far on Monday, let's continue where we left off.
#### Yvo's proposal for gradually increasing the percentage of spec-editors-approved tests
See https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/pull/1/files#diff-917c2d59bb084d79d9bbf4e18c3de046e7b88e2562586ce0fc0cded9e8867b3bR145

#### Sarven's proposal to mark tests that are not approved by the Editors Team as out of scope for the Charter.
#### Sarven's proposal to only publish reports if Software maintainers give consent to do so.
#### Sarven's assumption that Charter may be updated based on the needs of the CG.
#### PROPOSAL-1: Specify criteria for publishing test summaries and reports. Sarven proposes ACTION for Solid Editors Team by 2022-05-23.
#### PROPOSAL-2: Specify criteria for test suite and test metadata. Sarven proposes ACTION for test software maintainers by 2022-05-23.
#### PROPOSAL-3: Specify criteria for assessing tests and reports. Sarven proposes ACTION for spec contributors by 2022-05-23.
#### PROPOSAL-4: Review results of PROPOSALS-1 to PROPOSALS-3. Sarven proposes ACTION for Test Suite Panel by 2022-05-23.
#### PROPOSAL-5: Propose Test Suite Panel Charter. ACTION for SC by 2022-05-30.
#### PROPOSAL-6: Review Test Suite Panel Charter. ACTION for TBL by 2022-06-06.
